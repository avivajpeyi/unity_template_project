## Principles of Unit Testing

Unit tests are supposed to check the functionality of small units of your code, not the whole codebase. Unit tests are not meant to be integration tests/functional automation tests.

### Requirements:
1. 15ms run time for unit tests
2. only test what you code
3. mock other's code
4. categorize tests
