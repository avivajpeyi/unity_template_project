# CONTRIBUTING

We use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from dev.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints and project can build
6. Issue that pull request!
